-- Data Exploration
-- Skills used: Aggregate functions, Joins, and Converting Data Types
--		Aliasing, CTEs, TEMP table
-- create a new data column from existing data in 2 seperate datasets.
-- query the new column for another new column to be visualized.

-- step one
-- get data from the 2 seperate datasets
-- this will be done using JOINS
-- table names will be given aliases using the AS statement
-- aliasing table names will help shorten text

-- step three (A)
-- create new column "allvax"
-- this will be done using the aggregate function SUM, and GROUP BY statement
-- the value type for the output will be converted from a VCHAR to an INT
-- conversion will be done using the CAST query
-- the output will be assigned a BIGINT to accomodate the output values
-- the new column will be given an ALIAS "allvax"

-- alternative value-type conversion
-- conversion will be done using the CONVERT statement
-- the output will be assigned a BIGINT to accomodate the output values

-- step four (A)
-- a new column "vaxrate" will be created
-- this will be done using an already existing column and the newly created column "allvax"
-- first we'll create a CTE to validate the newly created column to enable us query the data successfully
-- next we'll query the CTE to create new column "vaxrate"
-- the vaxrate will be the percentage output of vaccinated population
